## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `com.backbase.assesment.movies.BackbaseMoviesApplication` class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use the **Spring Boot Maven plugin** like so:

```shell
.\mvnw spring-boot:run
```
